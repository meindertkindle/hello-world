# hello-world
my first git project

this is my first git project, nescessary to enhace my skills in PHP programming.
I'm using this book, that will instruct me to use modern PHP ans it's using code example.
these code examples are stroed nd available in Git hub.

Besides modern PHP )OOP, etc), I need all the skills belonging to a modern softare developer 
This s part hobby, part as a backup in case I will be laid off in my current profession as appliacation engineer
